# Revolutionizing Clustering with Customized Multi-Modal Subspace Proxy Learning (CMMSPL)

Welcome to the **CMMSPL** repository! This project is based on a research paper, which proposes a groundbreaking method to improve the efficiency and accuracy of clustering multi-modal data. Which combines **multi-modal data handling**, **subspace learning**, and **proxy-based clustering** to create a scalable, effective clustering solution.

## Overview

In the world of data science, clustering plays a crucial role in organizing complex datasets. Traditional clustering methods struggle with large, multi-modal data, leading to scalability issues and inaccurate results. This approach, **Customized Multi-Modal Subspace Proxy Learning (CMMSPL)**, addresses these challenges by efficiently handling multiple types of data (e.g., images, text) and scaling seamlessly for real-world applications.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**: The data is first normalized and cleaned to ensure consistency across different modalities.  
2. **Feature Extraction**: Meaningful features are extracted from images and text using pre-trained models like ResNet and BERT.  
3. **Proxy Generation**: Representative proxies are created to facilitate efficient clustering.  
4. **Subspace Clustering**: Subspace learning is applied to project the data into lower dimensions and group similar data points effectively.

## Results

The experiments demonstrate that **CMMSPL** significantly outperforms traditional clustering methods in the following areas:  
- **Clustering accuracy**  
- **Scalability** for large datasets  
- **Runtime efficiency**  

### Example of Results:  
The method was tested on datasets such as **MSCOCO** and **Flickr30k**, which include image-text data. The results show a **20% improvement** in clustering accuracy compared to baseline methods like K-means and spectral clustering.

## Applications

- **Personalized Recommendations**: **CMMSPL** can be leveraged for personalized recommendations by clustering users based on their behavior or preferences.  
- **Multi-Modal Data Analytics**: It can analyze data from multiple modalities (text, images, audio) to derive valuable insights.  
- **Image-Text Search Engines**: The approach can be used to develop systems that enable users to search for images using textual queries or vice versa.
